lets go to future perfect
Sure, let's talk about the future perfect!

The future perfect is a verb tense that describes an action that will be completed at some point in the future before another action takes place. It's formed using "will have" + past participle.

For example, "By this time tomorrow, I will have finished my homework." This means that the speaker will finish their homework at some point before tomorrow, and by this time tomorrow, the homework will already be complete.

The future perfect is often used to talk about actions that will be completed before a specific point in time in the future. Here are some more examples:

By the time I graduate, I will have studied for four years.
By next summer, they will have been married for 10 years.
By the end of the week, I will have read three books.
