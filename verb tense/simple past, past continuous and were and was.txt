lets go to next, simple past and past continuous how difference between them?
Sure, let's move on to simple past and past continuous!

The simple past tense is used to describe completed actions or states that occurred in the past. It is formed by adding -ed to the base form of regular verbs, or by using the second form of irregular verbs. For example:

I walked to the store yesterday.
She wrote a letter to her friend last night.
The past continuous tense, on the other hand, is used to describe ongoing or continuous actions or states that were in progress at a specific time in the past. It is formed by using the past tense of the verb "to be" (was/were) and adding the present participle (-ing) of the main verb. For example:

They were walking along the beach when it started to rain.
He was playing the guitar while she was singing.
In summary, the simple past tense is used to talk about completed actions in the past, while the past continuous tense is used to talk about ongoing actions or states in progress at a specific time in the past.

so if im doing a walk that i started a few minutes ago and i not finished yes i should say i was walking ?
Yes, that's correct! If you want to describe an action that you were in the middle of doing at a specific time in the past, you would use the past continuous tense. For example, if you started a walk a few minutes ago and you haven't finished yet, you would say:

"I was walking in the park when I saw a bird."

This sentence implies that the action of walking was in progress at a specific time in the past, and it was interrupted by seeing the bird.

However, if you want to describe a completed action that occurred in the past, you would use the simple past tense. For example:

"I walked in the park yesterday."

This sentence describes a completed action that occurred in the past (walking in the park), with no implication of interruption or ongoing action.

so if i finished a walk i should say i walked
Yes, that's correct! If you want to describe a completed action that occurred in the past, such as finishing a walk, you would use the simple past tense. For example:

"I walked in the park this morning and enjoyed the scenery."

This sentence implies that the action of walking was completed in the past and there was no ongoing action at a specific time in the past.

can you explain when i use was or were make a table with verb to be with were and was

Sure! Here's a table that shows when to use "was" and "were" with the verb "to be":

Subject	"Was"	"Were"
I	was	
You	were	
He/She/It	was	
We		were
They		were
Use "was" with the pronouns "I", "he", "she", and "it". Example: He was happy yesterday.

Use "were" with the pronouns "you", "we", and "they". Example: They were playing soccer yesterday.

Remember that the verb "to be" can also be used in the present tense, such as "am", "is", and "are". In the present tense, you would use "am" with "I", "is" with "he", "she", and "it", and "are" with "you", "we", and "they".

so verify if i understand i go use was to 3third person and to 1 st person, and i use were to second 
Close, but not quite! You use "was" for the third person singular (he, she, it) and first person singular (I). You use "were" for the second person singular (you), and all persons plural (we, they).

So the correct rule is: Use "was" for singular subjects (I, he, she, it) and "were" for plural subjects (we, you, they).

Here are some examples to help clarify:

I was at the store.

He was studying for his exam.

She was running in the park.

It was a beautiful day.

You were at the concert.

We were watching a movie.

They were playing soccer.

I hope that helps!
