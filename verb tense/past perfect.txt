lets study now past perfect
Great, let's talk about past perfect!

The past perfect is used to talk about an action or event that happened before another past action or event. It's formed by using the auxiliary verb "had" followed by the past participle of the main verb.

For example: "I had finished my homework before I went to bed."

In this sentence, "had finished" is the past perfect verb form, indicating that the action of finishing homework happened before the past action of going to bed.

can you explain more and comparate with simples present 
Sure, I'll give you a more detailed explanation and also compare the past perfect with the simple past.

The simple past is used to talk about actions or events that happened at a specific time in the past. For example: "I went to the store yesterday."

The past perfect, on the other hand, is used to talk about an action or event that happened before another past action or event. For example: "I had already eaten dinner when my friend came over."

In this sentence, "had eaten" is the past perfect verb form, indicating that the action of eating dinner happened before the past action of the friend coming over.

To form the past perfect, you use the auxiliary verb "had" followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example: "I had studied for two hours before the exam."

It's important to note that the simple past and past perfect can be used together in a sentence to show the sequence of events. For example: "I went to the store after I had finished my homework."

In this sentence, "had finished" is the past perfect verb form, indicating that the action of finishing homework happened before the past action of going to the store. The simple past verb "went" is used to show the action that happened after the past perfect action.
