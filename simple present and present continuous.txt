let's start with b1, I want that you explain details by details  present simple and present continuous, what is example I want to know all grammatic about this

2 / 2

Sure, I'd be happy to explain the details of present simple and present continuous, along with some examples.

Present Simple:
The present simple is a tense used to describe actions that are habitual, routine, or generally true. It is formed by using the base form of the verb, with -s or -es added in the third person singular (he, she, it). For example:

I eat breakfast every morning.
She walks to work.
He speaks Spanish fluently.
In the present simple, we use adverbs of frequency (such as always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never) to describe how often an action occurs. For example:

She always drinks coffee in the morning.
I usually go to bed early.
They rarely eat fast food.
We also use the present simple to express general truths or things that are always true. For example:

The Earth orbits around the sun.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Dogs bark.
Present Continuous:
The present continuous, also called the present progressive, is used to describe actions that are happening right now or in the near future. It is formed by using the present tense of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are) with the -ing form of the main verb. For example:

She is watching TV right now.
They are studying for their exams.
I am not feeling well.
We also use the present continuous to describe actions that are happening around now, but not necessarily at the exact moment of speaking. For example:

I'm taking a dance class this week.
He's working on a project for school.
They're planning a trip for next month.
Additionally, we can use the present continuous to describe temporary situations or changes happening in the present moment. For example:

She's getting better at playing the guitar.
They're moving to a new apartment next week.
I'm starting a new job in a few days.
It's important to note that the present simple and present continuous are often used together to describe routines or habits in the present moment. For example:

I usually eat breakfast at 7am, but today I'm eating at 8am.
She always walks to work, but today she's taking the bus.
He usually wears a suit to work, but today he's wearing jeans.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more information on any other topics.

i want that you make  a temporary line with frequency of adverbs of frequency
Sure, here is a list of adverbs of frequency arranged in order from most frequent to least frequent:

always
usually
often
sometimes
rarely
hardly ever
never
Keep in mind that the use of these adverbs can vary depending on the context of the sentence. For example, "always" may be used to describe something that happens frequently, while "never" is used to describe something that never happens.

i want know the about the order that come adverb of frenquecy in all type like with verb to be, without, in quests with verb to be, without in quest, negative with and without verb to be, any combination possivel i want know when come adverb of frequency
Sure, I'll do my best to explain the placement of adverbs of frequency in various sentence structures:

Present simple (without "to be"):
Affirmative: subject + adverb + base verb
Example: She always eats breakfast.
Negative: subject + do/does + not + adverb + base verb
Example: He does not usually drink coffee.
Question: do/does + subject + adverb + base verb?
Example: Do you often go to the gym?
Present continuous (without "to be"):
Affirmative: subject + adverb + be verb + present participle
Example: They are always talking about politics.
Negative: subject + be verb + not + adverb + present participle
Example: He is not usually working on weekends.
Question: be verb + subject + adverb + present participle?
Example: Is she often running in the park?
Present simple and continuous (with "to be"):
Affirmative: subject + adverb + present participle or base verb + "to be"
Example: She is always studying or She always is studying.
Negative: subject + "to be" + not + adverb + present participle or base verb
Example: They are not usually watching TV or They usually are not watching TV.
Question: "to be" + subject + adverb + present participle or base verb?
Example: Are you often reading books or Are you reading books often?
Keep in mind that the placement of adverbs of frequency can vary depending on the emphasis you want to give to the sentence. For example, you can place the adverb of frequency at the beginning or end of the sentence for emphasis:

Always, she goes to bed early.
She goes to bed early, always.
I hope this helps!

matheus gusman
in this exemple: Example: He does not usually drink coffee.
can i use doesÂ´nt in replace a does not?
Yes, you can use "doesn't" instead of "does not" in the given example. "Doesn't" is a contraction of "does not" and they have the same meaning. So the sentence can be written as "He doesn't usually drink coffee."




matheus gusman
verify if is true in present simples the adverb of frequency aways came before verb
In general, the adverb of frequency comes before the main verb in the simple present tense. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Here are a few examples:

When the main verb is "to be," the adverb of frequency comes after the verb:

She is often late for class.
They are rarely home before 9pm.
When using imperatives, the adverb of frequency comes before the main verb:

Always remember to turn off the lights before leaving the room.
Never forget to say please and thank you.
When using "do" or "does" as an auxiliary verb, the adverb of frequency comes after the auxiliary verb:

Do you always eat breakfast?
He doesn't usually watch TV in the morning.
So while the general rule is to place the adverb of frequency before the main verb in the simple present tense, there are some exceptions to this rule.




matheus gusman
so the adverb of frequency every comes after the subject?
No, the adverb "every" is an exception to the general rule that adverbs of frequency come before the main verb in the simple present tense. "Every" is typically used to indicate a specific time period or frequency and usually comes before the noun it modifies. Here are a few examples:

I go to the gym every Monday and Wednesday.
She eats a salad every day for lunch.
They have a team meeting every week on Friday.
In these examples, "every" comes before the noun (Monday, day, week) and not before the verb.




matheus gusman
in interrogative phrase the adverb of frequency every comes after the subject?
Yes, in interrogative sentences, the adverb "every" typically comes after the subject. Here are a few examples:

Do you go to the gym every Monday and Wednesday?
Does she eat a salad every day for lunch?
Do they have a team meeting every week on Friday?
In these examples, "every" follows the subject pronoun "you," "she," and "they."




matheus gusman
in present continuous adverb of frequency every comes after present participle?
In general, the adverb of frequency comes before the present participle (-ing form) in the present continuous tense. Here are a few examples:

I am always studying for exams.
They are rarely going to the movies these days.
She is usually wearing a red shirt on Fridays.
However, just like in the simple present tense, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, when using "to be" as the main verb, the adverb of frequency usually comes after the verb:

He is often being silly in class.
They are seldom being serious about their work.
So while the general rule is to place the adverb of frequency before the present participle in the present continuous tense, there are some exceptions to this rule.




matheus gusman
the adverb of frequency every comes before the subject?
No, in the present continuous tense, the adverb of frequency "every" generally comes before the present participle (-ing form) and after the subject. Here are a few examples:

I am exercising every morning before work.
She is attending yoga class every Saturday.
They are practicing their English skills every day after school.
In these examples, "every" follows the subject and precedes the present participle verb. However, there may be some exceptions depending on the specific sentence construction.




matheus gusman
in the interogative negative ou afirmative the adverb always is third?
No, the position of the adverb "always" in a sentence can vary depending on the sentence type and structure. Here are some examples:

Affirmative sentence with subject + verb + adverb: She always arrives early to work.
Negative sentence with subject + auxiliary verb + not + adverb + main verb: They are not always on time for meetings.
Interrogative sentence with auxiliary verb + subject + adverb + main verb: Do you always go to the gym in the mornings?
Interrogative negative sentence with auxiliary verb + subject + not + adverb + main verb: Isn't he always so forgetful?
As you can see, the position of the adverb "always" can change depending on the type of sentence and the presence of auxiliary verbs. In general, though, adverbs of frequency tend to be placed before the main verb in a sentence.




matheus gusman
in the interogative negative ou afirmative in present continuous the adverb always is third? when use  a contractive and not "not"
In the present continuous tense, the position of the adverb "always" can also vary depending on the type of sentence, and whether or not a contraction is used. Here are some examples:

Affirmative sentence with subject + am/is/are + adverb + present participle: She is always studying hard.
Negative sentence with subject + am/is/are + not + adverb + present participle: They are not always paying attention in class.
Interrogative sentence with am/is/are + subject + adverb + present participle: Is he always playing video games instead of doing his homework?
Interrogative negative sentence with am/is/are + subject + not + adverb + present participle: Aren't you always getting up early for work?
When using a contraction like "isn't" or "aren't" in the negative interrogative form, the adverb "always" would still come before the contracted auxiliary verb, as in the last example above.




matheus gusman
in present continuous  in affirmative adverb of frequency is the third  the negative is fourth in interrogative is third the interrogative negative is fourth
In general, the adverb of frequency "always" is placed before the verb in the present continuous tense. However, the specific word order can vary depending on the type of sentence (affirmative, negative, interrogative) and the presence of contractions. Here are some examples:

Affirmative sentence with subject + am/is/are + adverb + present participle: She is always studying hard.
Negative sentence with subject + am/is/are + not + adverb + present participle: They are not always paying attention in class. Here, "always" is still in the third position before the present participle verb, but after the negation "not".
Interrogative sentence with am/is/are + subject + adverb + present participle: Is he always playing video games instead of doing his homework? Here, "always" is in the third position after the subject but before the present participle verb.
Interrogative negative sentence with am/is/are + subject + not + adverb + present participle: Aren't you always getting up early for work? Here, "always" is in the fourth position after the negation "not", but before the present participle verb.
It's worth noting that the specific word order can be more flexible in spoken English, and can depend on emphasis and intonation. However, the general rule is to place "always" before the present participle verb in the present continuous tense.
